title: "Predicting Pitch Sequence - Classification Example"

One of the hottest MLB stories after the 2019 offseason was the uncovering of the Houston Astros sign-stealing scheme. It was discovered that the Astros were using video feeds during the 2017 season to steal pitch signs from other teams. They would then hit a trashcan loudly to indicate to the batter that the next pitch was a fastball or a breaking ball. Knowing that a fastball or breaking ball is coming can add a huge advantage to the hitter because they will know how to time their next swing. To add even more to the controversty, the Astros won the 2017 World Series. 

As a fun classification project, I would like to see if there is a way using machine learning to replace the trash-can method. Is there a way using historical pitching data if we can predict the next pitch from a pitcher given the in-game scenario?

To do this I will be scraping real-world Statcast data from MLB Baseball Savant in Python from an example pitcher. I will then use Adaboost to quickly match a model to the data. I will then evaluate the model to see if we have any advantage from data alone on what pitch will be coming next.

Coming Soon!
